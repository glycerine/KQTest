NAME
    iotest - Write Read & Verify

SYNOPSIS
    iotest [/path/to/file] [-oiVwryxqtPFfkTvsS]


DESCRIPTION
    Shared command line arguments and their descriptions are as follows:
    
    -o|--output  [/path/to/filename|-]
     Use the output specification to explicitly define a destination for writing.
        
    If output is specified as '-', the contents of the file are piped to stdout.
    Direct and mmap I/O methods are not supported. Random sequence is also not
    supported.More than one threads are not supported.
        
    -i|--input   [/path/to/filename|-]
    Use the input specification to explicitly define a source for reading.
        
    If input is specified as '-', the contents of the file are piped from stdin.
    Direct and mmap I/O methods are not supported. Random sequence is also not
        supported. More than one threads are not supported.
        
    -V|--verify

    Enable or disable the verification of data.
    Verification implies that the same data is read back which was written
    earlier.
        
    -w|--write [offset=],[count=],[iosize=],[miniosize=],[maxiosize=],[size=],
               [sleep=],[minsleep=],[maxsleep]
        offset - Starting offset for the I/O operations.(In Bytes,Default 0)
             count  - Number of I/O operations.
        iosize - Block size of the operations.(In Bytes)
        miniosize - Lower limit for block size while using random iosize.
        maxiosize - Upper limit for block size while using random iosize.
        size   - Total size of the I/O operations.(In Bytes)
        sleep  - Sleep between each I/O operation.(In seconds)
        minsleep - Lower limit for sleep while using random sleep interval.
        maxsleep - Upper limit for sleep while using random sleep interval.
        
        iosize is equal to block of the data which will be written in one operation.
        
    -r|--read [offset=],[count=],[iosize=],[miniosize=],[maxiosize=],[size=],
               [sleep=],[minsleep=],[maxsleep]
        offset - Starting offset for the I/O operations(Default 0).
        count  - Number of I/O operations.
        iosize - Block size of the operations.
        miniosize - Lower limit for block size while using random iosize.
        maxiosize - Upper limit for block size while using random iosize.
        size   - Total size of the I/O operations.
        sleep  - Sleep between each I/O operation.(In Milli-seconds)
        minsleep - Lower limit for sleep while using random sleep interval.
        maxsleep - Upper limit for sleep while using random sleep interval.
        
         iosize is equal to block of the data which will be read in one operation.
        
    -y|--writethreads [count]
    Number of threads to write data. (Default 1, Max 16)

    -x|--readthreads [count]
    Number of threads to read data.  (Default 1, Max 16)

    -q|--sequence [seq|random]
        Use the sequence argument to define whether data is written/read in a
        random (which requires forward and backward seeks) or non-random manner.
        (Default seq).

    -t|--type [sparse|non-sparse]
    Use the type argument to specify whether file is sparse or not.
    (Default non-sparse)
        
    -P|--pattern [string]
    Data-pattern to use in the writing and reading/verification of data.

    -F|--Pattern [filename]
    Data-pattern to use in the writing and reading/verification of data.

    If neither -P nor -F option is specified, "0123456789" will be used
    as default pattern.
                
    -f|--rflags  [options]
    Use the rflags argument to specify I/O method for reading.
    mmap        Memory Mapped I/O (Default I/O method)
    directio    Direct I/O
    bufferedio  Buffered I/O

    -k|--wflags  [options]
    Use the wflags argument to specify I/O method for writing.
    mmap        Memory Mapped I/O (Default I/O method)
    directio    Direct I/O
    bufferedio  Buffered I/O
        
    -T|--timeout seconds
    To specify the allowed run time for the iotest tool.If the execution does not
    finish within the specified timeout value, the tool will exit with error.
    (Default -1 (No timeout))

    Timeout has optional floating-point (millisecond) precision.
    e.g. 2.4
        
    -v|-vv|--verbose [verbosity]
     Use the verbose flag to increase the information displayed for any I/O
     operation.
        
    -s|--sparseness [factor]
        Define the sparseness factor to be used (Default 1).
        
    For example if the count is 10, iosize is 4096 and sparseness factor is 2;
    the file of the size created will be 81920.This parameter will be used if
    the --type argument says sparse. In case of non-sparse the argument will be
    ignored and rejected if    value is greater than 1
     
    -S|--seed [value]
        Define the seed value to be used for pseudo-random function (Default 0).

    -n|--nice [value]
        Specify the nice value to change the scheduling priority of the process.

RETURN VALUE
        0         when program finishes successfully.
        -1        when opening a file fails.
        ENOMEM=12 when allocation for requested memory fails.
        ESPIPE=29 when lseek fails.
        EINVAL=22 when Invalid argument passed.
        EACCES=13 when permission is denied for the requested operation.

Data Corruption:
        If there is corruption in an IO block, it will be reported in a
        corruption log file,
        
        with details in format:-
        First 8 bytes of the corruption, followed by "..", followed by the last
        8 bytes of the corruption, followed by a list of the starting and ending
        offsets of the corruption.
        For example:-
        12345678..90ABCDEF (start,end)

        The name of the file will be corruption_log_<PID> to keep it it unique.
        PID is the process-id of the process.
